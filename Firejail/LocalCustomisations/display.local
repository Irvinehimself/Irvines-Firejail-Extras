# Local customisations for display

# The display firejail profile only covers a subset of ImageMagick commands. Since
# I am writing a dedicated apparmor profile for usr.bin.magick to cover all the
# commands and /usr/bin/display links to /usr/bin/magick, we need to disable apparmor
# for this profile.
ignore apparmor
